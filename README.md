# Image_Colorization
Using autoencoder architecture of neural networks, converting given grayscale image to RGB image.\
I worked as a summer intern at IVlabs, Nagpur from May, 2022 to October, 2022.\ 
During this phase, I explored about the deep learning. The workflow was:\
a) MNIST digit classifier using fully connected neural networks\
b) Improving deep neural networks via batch normalization, regularizations which include L1, L2, dropout, hyperparameter tuning\
c) MNIST digit classifier by incorporating convolution neural networks\
d) Use of autoencoders in reproducing the same images given as input( we used MNIST images )\
e) Using Resnet-18-Gray and autoencoder architecture, we succesfully build model to colorize given grayscale images\
